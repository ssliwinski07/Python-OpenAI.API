# Python-OpenAI.API

API server for testing OpenAI API - it's still in progress and new features are being added. For now it has one method to fetch OpenAI API key. Will be expanded by:

1. Adding method to send a message to OpenAI and receive a reply from chat model - üõ†Ô∏è in progress
2. Creating services for each API method to separate api logic and make the code more maintainable. - ‚úÖ done for `api_key_service`
3. Services will be implemented using production and mock versions to test the code + base services to work as interfaces that can be implemented in production/mock services. - ‚úÖ done
4. API classes will use dependency injection to get services from the container - package `injector` - ‚úÖ done for `ApiKeyApi`

# Installation

App was build using Python 3.12.2.

1. Create system environment variable `API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key - it's required for the app to work properly when checking the API key that is being send in API request.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
3. Run `python app.py` to start the app - it will run on localhost at port 8040.

# Other information

1. API docs is available at `http://localhost:8040/api/docs`
2. UsersAPI class and its methods were only created as a test to show how function `verify_api_key` from `ApiServer` works.
3. `verify_api_key` function checks if the API key passed in header API request is valid on the endpoints that are not public - those endpoints requires to pass authorization header with API key.
